# Resume_parser
This project automates resume parsing using Google's Gemini AI. It extracts key details (name, contact, skills, experience) from PDFs with PyPDF2. Batch processing via concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor ensures efficiency. The structured data is saved in an Excel file, streamlining HRâ€™s recruitment process.
